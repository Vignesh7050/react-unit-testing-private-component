# Testing Private Components

- Added simple ChildComponent and ParentComponent where ChildComponent is passed as a children prop to the
  parent Component
- Here we are passing buttonComponent prop to the ChildComponent where it returns jsx (simple button component)
  when it is called from the ChildComponent, Implementation of the buttonComponent (private component) is handled in the App.js component
- For more details added inline documentation under App.test.js file
